# Jobbed Out

We're going to use what we learned this week about single page applications and front end frameworks to build a single page job link aggregator called "Jobbed Out".

## User Stories
- A user should be able to add a new job
- A user should be able to delete a job
- A user should be able to search for a job by "title" or "company"
- A user should be able to sort jobs by "createdAt", "title", or "company"

## Bonus
- A user should be able to update a job's title, company or link
- A user should see a loading gif anytime content is being fetched from the server
- A user should be able to see 5 jobs on the page when they load up the app
- A user should be able to load the next 5 jobs on the page when they click the "Load More" button

## Requirements
- Pick a front end framework we learned this week (either AngularJS or React) and use it to update the views and talk to the server
